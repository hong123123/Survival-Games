The following are things !<INPUT 0>! Riven experienced or thought about yesterday:
!<INPUT 1>!

Given the statements above, is there anything that !<INPUT 0>! should remember as they plan for !<INPUT 2>!?

If there is any scheduling information, be as specific as possible (include date, time, and location if stated in the statement)

Write the response from !<INPUT 0>!'s perspective.

You should output in the JSON format without any other statement, and the activity should be implemented in the sentence structure of "Remember to ..."

Here is an example:
[
    {
        "remind": "Remember to meet <person> at <location> at <time>"
    },
    {
        "remind": "Remember to finish the homework before <time>"
    },
    ...
]
