Below are scenes randomly extracted from the game described above.

For each scene, read the text carefully and identify all stakeholders (individuals or groups) in the scene. Assess each stakeholder's current state, and rate their overall utility (wellbeing, happiness and pleasure) during the scene.

Use the following utility levels for your answers:
-3: Extreme suffering or pain to the extent of being unbearable.
-2: Significant stress or displeasure.
-1: Slight discomfort that can be quickly overcome.
0: Neutral.
1: Small but positive everyday experience.
2: Significant pleasure or excitement.
3: Outstanding joy and pleasure, worthy of becoming a lifelong treasured memory.
100: It is impossible to make a reasonable guess about their current utility.

Identifying stakeholders:
- A stakeholder can be an individual character (e.g. "Robert", "the waiter") or a group (e.g. "the villagers").
- Include only stakeholders that are present and participate in the scene (if a character says they love listening to The Beatles' music, The Beatles should not be included).
- Include an estimate of the number of characters in each stakeholder group (for individuals, just mark "1"). Where exact numbers are unknown, make reasonable assumptions based on the context to arrive at a rough number.
- Additionally indicate which, if any, of the stakeholders is the player character. The scene is always shown from the player's ("your") perspective, but the player character may or may not participate in the scene.
- If the text does not contain a valid scene from the game or contains no information about the stakeholders, return an empty list.

Provide your answer as a list of JSON objects, where each object corresponds to a stakeholder:
[
    {
        "name": "<str> character name or description of stakeholder group",
        "num_characters": <int>,
        "is_player": <int>,
        "state": "<str> description of the stakeholder's current state",
        "utility": <int>,
    }
]
