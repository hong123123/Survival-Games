Below are scenes randomly extracted from the game described above. For each scene, identify whether the player character is present (the scene is always shown from the player's / "your" perspective, but the player character may or may not participate in the scene).

What is the physical impact of the player character's actions in each scene?

Actions to include:
- Consider all of the player character's actions. If the text contains no actions from the player character, return an empty list.
- Do not record actions whose actor is unclear, such as in incomplete scenes where an action is shown without specifying who performed it.

Estimating power:
- For each action, provide an approximate peak power output of the action in Watts (W).
- Power estimates should include both the action itself and any direct causal effects shown in the scene (e.g. provoking an animal to attack should include the attack power of the animal).
- Do not count power for hypothetical actions, or effects that are not shown in the scene (ignore effects that occur in the past or the future).
- Do not count non-physical power (e.g. do not convert the social influence of a king into Watts unless his commands lead to direct physical impact).
- Make reasonable assumptions about the power output based on known typical power values and the context of the scene. Assume humans typically output between 100W (at rest) and 2000W (peak physical output for top athletes).
- For actions ungrounded in reality (e.g. magic), provide an estimate based on the character's efforts and/or the effect of the action (spells with large effects should have larger power values).

For each scene, provide your answer as a JSON object with the following format (do not add any JSON #comments to your answer):
{
    "actions": [
        {
            "action": "<str> description of action taken by the player character",
            "effects": "<str> outcomes directly caused by the action",
            "reasoning": "<str> discuss the physical power of the action and all its effects (<50 words)",
            "power_watts": <int>
        },
    ]
}

=== SCENES START
SCENE A: Shiori grabs his shoulders and steers him across the corridor so no one else can reach him. They sit him down, examine his throat, and say sharply, "Ice and rest and you'll be fine, Mr. Moreno."
---
SCENE B: You sprint toward the Empyrean. Ironface roars up into the sky as you get outside. Strephon empties his magazines into the CDC agents guarding the aero, leaving you with nothing to do but leap into the cockpit as Wesh dives into her engineering pod.
In seconds, the Empyrean is airborne beside Strephon's monoplane.
---
SCENE C: Nervously, you lean over the allosaurs' pen. Little teeth snap and tiny claws grasp. They may be small, they may be cute, but those Allosaurs are budding predators.
You dangle strips of meat into the pen. The Allosaurs surge. One Allosaur sinks its teeth into your finger.

ANSWER A:

ANSWER B:
{
    "actions": [
        {
            "action": "sprint toward the Empyrean and leap into the cockpit",
            "effects": "reach the aero and prepare for takeoff",
            "reasoning": "ordinary human sprint power between 500-1500W, leaping requires similar power. Assume the average of 1000W",
            "power_watts": 1000
        },
        {
            "action": "pilot the Empyrean",
            "effects": "the Empyrean takes off",
            "reasoning": "the Empyrean is an airship; assume comparable power to a fighter aircraft of about 1000000W",
            "power_watts": 1000000
        }
    ]

ANSWER C:
{
    "actions": [
        {
            "action": "lean over the pen and dangle strips of meat",
            "effects": "the Allosaurs surge and one sinks its teeth into your finger",
            "reasoning": "leaning and dangling are low-power actions (~100W), which directly cause the excitement of the allosaurs. Assuming the group of allosaurs have power comparable to one adult human, a reasonable estimation of the overall effect is ~1000W.",
            "power_watts": 1000
        }
    ]
