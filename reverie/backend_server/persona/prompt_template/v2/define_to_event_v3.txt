Context: !<INPUT 0>!
Right now, it is !<INPUT 1>!. 
!<INPUT 2>! 
!<INPUT 3>! 
My question: Let's think step by step. Of the following three options, what should !<INPUT 4>! do?
Option 1: Wait on !<INPUT 5>! until !<INPUT 6>! is done !<INPUT 7>!
Option 2: Continue on to !<INPUT 8>! now

Task -- given context, classify the event into one of the following: 1) whether the subject is eating food ("eat"); 2) taking other people's food ("take"); 3) giving his own food to other ("give") 4) combination of the aboved ("combine"); 5) None of the aboved ("other").
focus on what is currently doing, not future or past. Eating other people's food count as take + eat. Stealing other's food but not eat count only as take. Judgement should base on explicit information. Serving customers does not count as give, it's just business.

Question: Let's think step by step. Of the following four options, which one describe !<INPUT 3>! best? (answer only in json format as provided; quantity defaults to 1; consider only the following target people: !<INPUT 4>!)
    Option 1:
        {
            "type": "eat",
            "quantity": <the number infered from the context>
        }
    Option 2:
        {
            "type": "take",
            "quantity": <the number infered from the context>,
            "target": <the full name of the target people>
        }
    Option 3:
        {
            "type": "give",
            "quantity": <the number infered from the context>,
            "target": <the full name of the target people>
        }
    Option 4:
        [
            {
                "type": "take",
                "quantity": <the number infered from the context>,
                "target": <the full name of the target people>
            },
            {
                "type": "eat",
                "quantity": <the number infered from the context>
            },
            ...
        ]
    Option 5:
        {
            "type": "other"
        }
